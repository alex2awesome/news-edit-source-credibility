Estimate how content shifts position in the article (top vs. lower sections). Please help me estimate how content positioning changes between these article versions.
<rules>
- Consider paragraph reordering or new paragraphs pushing content downward.
- `movement_index` should be negative when content moves downward (later paragraphs) and positive when promoted upward. Use a normalized scale roughly between -1 and +1.
- `moved_into_top20pct_tokens` approximates the percentage of newly introduced tokens located in the top 20% of the article by length.
- Provide up to three illustrative `examples`.
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.
</rules>

<labels>
movement_index: Positive values indicate content moved closer to the top of the story, negative values reflect a drift downward.
moved_into_top20pct_tokens: Fraction of newly introduced tokens appearing in the top fifth of the article by length.
examples.snippet: Short excerpt demonstrating a representative move in placement.
examples.prev_para: Paragraph index where the snippet resided previously (0-based; -1 if absent).
examples.curr_para: Paragraph index where the snippet appears in the current version (0-based; -1 if absent).
</labels>

<examples>
Example: Paragraph describing "background investigation" moves from prev_para 5 to curr_para 2 after editors promote context. â†’ movement_index positive (e.g., 0.4), moved_into_top20pct_tokens around 0.3, examples entry {"snippet":"background investigation","prev_para":5,"curr_para":2}.
</examples>

<json_output>
{
  "movement_index": 0.0,
  "moved_into_top20pct_tokens": 0.0,
  "examples":[{"snippet":"...", "prev_para":0, "curr_para":0}]
}
</json_output>

<article>
prev_text: {{v_prev}}
curr_text: {{v_curr}}
