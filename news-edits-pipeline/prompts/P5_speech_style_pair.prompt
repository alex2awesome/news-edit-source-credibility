Detect transitions between direct and indirect speech for recurring sources. Please help me detect how speech style shifts for recurring sources across these versions.
<rules>
- Count quoted words difference using best approximation (number of tokens in quotations).
- Use `prev_source_mentions` and `curr_source_mentions` (JSON lists); each source entry includes `canonical`, `type`, `centrality`, `narrative_function`, `attributed_text`, `speech_style`, and `attribution_verb`.
- `change` indicates net movement; use `unchanged` when the balance is consistent.
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.
</rules>

<labels>
speech_style_changes.change.direct_to_indirect: The later version shifts a source from quoted speech to paraphrased or indirect speech.
speech_style_changes.change.indirect_to_direct: The later version introduces direct quotations where paraphrase was used previously.
speech_style_changes.change.unchanged: The balance of direct and indirect speech remains effectively the same.
</labels>

<examples>
Example: Source quoted with "\"We will rebuild,\" the mayor said" becomes paraphrased "The mayor said the city would rebuild." â†’ change "direct_to_indirect", delta_quoted_words negative reflecting fewer quoted words.
</examples>

<json_output>

  "speech_style_changes":[
    {"canonical":"...", "change":"direct_to_indirect|indirect_to_direct|unchanged", "delta_quoted_words": 0}
