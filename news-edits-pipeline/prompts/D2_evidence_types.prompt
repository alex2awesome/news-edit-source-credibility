Classify evidence cited in the text and link it to the providing source when feasible. Please help me identify and classify the evidence cited in this article version.
<rules>
Evidence refers to any support offered for factual claims (documents, data, testimony).
- Use the provided `source_mentions` catalog to link evidence to canonical sources whenever possible; fall back to text-only reasoning when the list is empty.
- If the same evidence supports multiple claims, list once and note the predominant source.
- Copy the supporting passage verbatim into `evidence_text`; do not paraphrase or trim quotation marks.
- Evidence types:
  - `official_statement`: formal remarks or press conferences.
  - `press_release`: language clearly from a press statement.
  - `eyewitness`: on-the-ground witness, participant.
  - `document`: reports, memos, written records.
  - `statistic`: numeric findings, surveys, tallies.
  - `prior_reporting`: references to other outlets.
  - `social_media`: posts on platforms.
  - `court_filing`: legal complaints, indictments.
  - `other`: any remaining category (specify briefly in span text).
- Report `confidence` on a 1â€“5 scale (1 = very low, 5 = very high).
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.
