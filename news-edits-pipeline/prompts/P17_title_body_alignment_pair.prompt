Measure how well the headline aligns with the early body paragraphs. Please help me measure how headline-body alignment shifts between these versions.
<rules>
- Compute Jaccard overlaps using lowercase token sets (punctuation removed). Return the numeric overlaps v0/v1 even though the orchestrator will also compute them.
- `title_sources_added/removed` enumerate entities whose names appear in one title but not the other.
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.
</rules>

<labels>
jaccard_overlap_prev: Token overlap score between the earlier headline and lede, ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical sets).
jaccard_overlap_curr: Token overlap score between the later headline and lede, ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical sets).
title_sources_added: Entities newly appearing in the current headline relative to the previous version.
title_sources_removed: Entities that were present in the previous headline but are now absent.
</labels>

<examples>
Example: Headline shifts from "Teachers strike in Chicago" to "Mayor, Union reach deal" while lede stays similar. â†’ jaccard_overlap_prev 0.6, jaccard_overlap_curr 0.4, title_sources_added ["Mayor"], title_sources_removed ["Teachers"].
</examples>

  "jaccard_overlap_curr": 0.0,
